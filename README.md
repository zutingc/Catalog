# Catalog
A catalog webpage shell that includes a card template for each catalog piece that can be tagged for sorting and searching. This was developed during my internship at Merck in 2022 and hollowed out to this format for viewing purposes.

This webpage used to be populated with 800+ data cards extracted from an external Project Lifecycle Management (PLM) using the update.html file. Due to the sensitive nature of the information, all of that has been stripped and replaced with placeholder cards that can be used to demo the functionality of this catalog.

Currently, update.html is only compatible with the PLM and is just provided here to demonstrate how the update process was initated.
